# TAIDE Chat 1.0.2
### Basic Software Requirements
* PostgreSQL 14
* Nodejs 18
* PHP & PHP-FPM 8.1
* Redis Server
* Vite (Use `npm install -g vite`)
### Setup the web
1. Clone this project by using `git clone`
2. Copy environment configure file `cp .env.debug .env`
3. Modify `.env` for your environment
4. Go under the folder `cd executables/sh`
5. Run the script `./install.sh`, this should install most of things you needed.
6. Then run the following commands here to start the web service
```shell
screen -dmS worker bash -c "./work.sh"
screen -dmS web bash -c "./startWeb_Public.sh"
```
### Setup Redis worker
7. Use another tty session or use `screen`, then execute `./work.sh` so you can start a fresh Redis worker
8. Now you need LLM API, I included some examples inside the folder `LLMs`, the code can be modified to use other LLMs(`LLaMA_TW1.py` require the trained model from 塗子謙)
9. For an easy sample you can begin with `Bloom_1b1-zh.py`, run `screen -dmS bloom bash -c "python3 Bloom_1b1-zh.py"`
10. Wait until it's done, you can use `screen -rx bloom` to attach the terminal, and use `Ctrl+A` then `D` to detach
11. Then you're all done, the service should work if nothing went wrong!
